  "description" : "The SharePoint Change Management Microapp Integration powers an automated change-request and approval process. The integration uses SharePoint as the System of Record and contains four Microapps enabling users to create change requests, pre-approve, approve, or reject requests, and confirm that an approved change has been implemented. The process is initiated when a user completes a quick and easy request form with pertinent information about the change. Each time a request is submitted pre-approval users are notified of the new submissions. When a request gains pre-approval, final approval users are notified. Anytime a request status is changed an e-mail is sent to the user who initially submitted the change request. Once the request has received final approval and has been completed, the requesting user can confirm the change has been implemented with one click leveraging the microapp. This Microapp Integration can be customized to accommodate almost any change management workflow that leverages SharePoint as the System of Record. This Microapp Integration is built using Microsoft SharePoint Online as a backend using Microsoft Power Automate or Logic Apps in Azure as a middleware to facilitate the integration.",
